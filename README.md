**Titanic**
- First time manipulating data
- Used numpy as primary method of analysis
- Used regression and random forest methods

**In Progress: MNIST**
- Used numpy again as primary method of analysis
- Implemented 3-layer convolutional neural network using stochastic gradient descent
- In progress: incorporating TensorFlow library for greater accuracy
