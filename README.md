# Kaggle
**Scripts for Kaggle submissions**

**\*.sh files**
- run scripts after activating virtual environment
- venv2.sh for python2
- venv3.sh for python3

**Titanic**
- First time manipulating data
- Used numpy as primary method of analysis
- Used regression and random forest methods

**In Progress: MNIST**
- Used numpy again as primary method of analysis
- Implemented 3-layer convolutional neural network using stochastic gradient descent (92% accuracy)
- In progress: incorporating TensorFlow library for greater accuracy
